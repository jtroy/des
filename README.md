# des
A Go implementation of the (**weak!**) Version 7 Unix DES password hashing algorithm. Ported from [a Java implementation](https://github.com/dekellum/jetty/blob/master/jetty-http/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/http/security/UnixCrypt.java) and minimally edited. Not idiomatic Go. You probably shouldn't use this.
